    "- Let g(t) be some time signal that’s sampled at $dt$ to get a discrete array/list `g = [ … ]`\n",
    "- You don’t need to code your own DFT, use numpy:  `A = numpy.fft.fft(g) * dt`\n",
    "- You should also use `numpy.fft.fftshift( A )` to shift the fft output such that the 0-frequency component is centered (see why here https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.fft.html#background-information) which you probably want when plotting\n",
    "- You can use `f_axis = numpy.fft.fftshift( numpy.fft.fftfreq(len(g), dt) )` to create the frequency axis for plotting the shifted spectrum\n",
    "- Keep in mind the fft output is in general complex, so to compare two fourier transforms (e.g. DFT vs CFT) you should compare either the real and imaginary parts ($z = x + i y$), or the phase and amplitude ($z = r e^{i\\theta}$ ). Amplitude plots are most useful for this lab, show all 4 aspects though if you want.\n",
    "- Note numpy fft assumes the time signal starts at $t = 0$, if yours doesn’t you should center it at zero. If you don’t then the complex components (x and y, or phase) will be off, but the amplitude should not change (why? analytically, recall that axis shifts in either domain are equivalent to complex exponential scaling, which has amplitude 1, in the other domain).\n",
    "- If your time signal g is centered at zero, a hack to ‘rotate it’ to start at zero (and then take the fft and fftshift that) is to do: `fftshift( fft( ifftshift(g) ) )` (you may see mention of this online)"
